mvcexample
==========

mvcexample is a small mvc framework I build while try to understand the concepts of MVC. I needed a way for the sales reps at my station to display videos I produced to their clients. I decided that it would be fun to build a MVC application to do it.

I continue to enhance it just for my own learning experience. This is not a project that will be useful to others. It is mainly a showcase for my code.

If you want to play with it you need sqlite and pdo driver for php.
